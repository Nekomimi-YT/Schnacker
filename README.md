* Will upload when app is complete

## Key Technologies:

* Expo, Android Studio - Development
* Firebase Firestore - Cloud Storage

## Key Features: 
* A page where users can enter their name and choose a background color for the chat screen before joining the chat.
* A page displaying the conversation, as well as an input field and submit button. 
* The chat must provide users with two additional communication features: sending images and location data. 
* Data gets stored online and offline. 
* Add an app shortcut to the home screen. 
* Easily view data about upcoming events.

## User Stories and Scenario Tests
